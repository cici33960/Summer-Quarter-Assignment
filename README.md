# Summer-Quarter-Assignment
About CommandLines and Python

Assignment 1

Q1-clean up a dataset by using Linux CommandLines

Q2-replace words in Python

Q3-define a function to count all characters read in from standard input

Q4-count certain characters in Python

Q5-create a beta function in Python

Assignment 2

Question1

Import and use the Boston housing dataset to fit a linear regression model using Gradient Descent. Create a linear model, def a function to compute the result of the model, and def an RMSE function for this purpose. Partition the Boston dataset into training and holdout (test) with a ratio of 90% to 10%, respectively. Terminate learning after a maximum of 10 epochs, and create a plot of the RMS error of your model after each epoch. Repeat the experiment for each of the following learning rates:0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.


Question2

Train a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the “Very Late Adopter” class using the customer dataset from Assignment 1 (a1_dataset.dat). Use data processing skills to turn the problem into a 2-class n-feature classification problem.
 
a) Train the model on the entire input data set (which is biased towards samples that are not “Very Late Adopter” - verify this for yourself using grep or something), 
b) also with pruning the input data so that there is a 50:50 ratio of samples of each target class: “Very Late Adopter” OR not “Very Late Adopter” For each mix of data don’t forget to reserve 10% for the testing set.
 
Plot the performance (Best Accuracy) on the test set.


Assignment 3

Dendrogram and Clustering-1

Perform hierarchical clustering analysis. Justify a cutting threshold and state the resulting number of clusters. Plot the dendrogram. Complete k-means clustering.

Dendrogram and Clustering-Titanic

Create dataset arrays from the JSON encoded data with 5 features. Perform hierarchical clustering analysis. Justify a cutting threshold and state the resulting number of clusters. Plot the dendrogram. Complete k-means clustering.
