"""
Write a function to decompose a DNA strand into its 4 nucleotide bases: A, T, C, G. Your function will warn whenever an illegal character is found and at what position. Use loops and if-else statements to solve this rather than using string.count() or regular expressions. Call your function from the main scope of your python program.
Your function shall have the name “decompose” and accept one string argument, it will perform like this:
decompose("CTATCGzGCACCCTTTCAG CA")
WARNING: Found illegal character ‘z’ at position 6
WARNING: Found illegal character ‘ ’ at position 19
{'A': 4, 'C': 8, 'T': 5, 'G': 3, ‘Other’: 2}
